#  AffectViz – Intuitive Health & Mood Visualization

**Transform raw health data into insight, clarity, and action.**  

AffectViz is an innovative visualization tool designed to make complex health metrics for activity, sleep and mood, **understandable, motivating, and actionable** for busy professionals. While traditional health and fitness tools present raw numbers and charts, users often struggle to interpret the data or connect it to meaningful lifestyle improvements. AffectViz bridges this gap by telling a **clear, emotional story** through intuitive visualizations.  

---

##  Problem & Vision

People aged **30–50 with high daily workloads** often face challenges in balancing career, family, and personal well-being. Although health apps collect valuable data (steps, calories, sleep quality, mood) the insights remain buried in numbers. Users want:

- Quick, meaningful insights  
- Data that tells a concise story  
- Tools to prevent burnout and maintain sustainable performance  

AffectViz translates this raw data into a **digestible, emotionally resonant visualization** that guides self-reflection and positive behavioral change.  

---

##  How AffectViz Works

AffectViz integrates multiple dimensions of health into a **single, cohesive visualization**:

1. **Integration:** Combines activity, sleep, and mood data in a meaningful, organized way.  
2. **Causality:** Highlights correlations and possible causal relationships between behaviors and well-being.  
3. **Behavioral Change:** Uses emotionally engaging visual metaphors to motivate users to act and optimize their daily routines.  

---

##  Design Challenge

The project focuses on creating a **high-fidelity prototype** that demonstrates:

- **Intuitive Visualization:** Go beyond standard graphs. Make complex relationships (the impact of sleep on mood) immediately visible.  
- **Emotional Appeal:** Encourage reflection and positive change through visual metaphors that resonate emotionally.  
- **Accessibility:** Ensure the interface is **user-friendly**, understandable at a glance, and adaptable to devices ranging from smartwatches to desktop dashboards.  
- **Impactful Design:** Aesthetic, believable, and motivating visuals that **drive measurable behavioral change**.

##  Goals

- Reveal connections between **behavior, stress, and recovery**.
